  <br /> Quantum networks build on entanglement and quantum measurement to achieve
  tasks that are beyond the reach of classical systems. Using quantum effects, we
  can detect the presence of eavesdroppers, raise the sensitivity of scientific instruments
  such as telescopes, or teleport quantum data from one location to another. Long-distance
  entanglement can be used to execute important tasks such as Byzantine agreement
  and leader election in fewer rounds of communication than classical systems, improving
  the efficiency of operations that are critical in distributed systems. ISBN: 978-1-84821-537-5
