# Research
The primary goal of AQUA is to advance the deployment of quantum technologies in the real world, principally by applying known techniques from classical computer architecture, networking and distributed systems to the problems of scalability in quantum systems. This work will both bring new computational capabilities and help ensure that the progress of information technology does not end when the size of transistors can no longer be reduced.

## Work Areas

### Devices
In conjunction with [the Yamamoto group](http://www.stanford.edu/group/yamamotogroup/) at Stanford University, we are designing semiconductor-based chips using quantum dots.

- Quantum Dots with Optically-controlled Spins (QuDOS) architecture
- [Racetrack architecture](https://aqua.sfc.wide.ad.jp/racetrack.html)

### Principles
We are searching for new principles in quantum architecture and networking, as well as applications of known principles.

- layered architectures, quantum multicomputer paradigm, graph embedding, quantum picturalism, beyond DiVincenzo criteria, surface code error correction
- [Quantum Multicomputer Architectures](https://aqua.sfc.wide.ad.jp/research/qmc/qmc.html)
- [Graph Embedding](https://aqua.sfc.wide.ad.jp/research/graph-embedding/graph-embedding.html)
- [Surface Code and Planar Code Error Correction](https://aqua.sfc.wide.ad.jp/research/planar-code/planar-code.html)
- [Quantum Picturalism](https://aqua.sfc.wide.ad.jp/research/picturalism/quantum-picturalism.html)

### Tools
Proper analysis of new ideas in architecture and networks requires software tools for compiling programs and optimizing their mapping to particular systems, as well as physical simulation of quantum devices and effects.
We are also developing QuISP(Quantum Internet Simulation Package), which is a tool you can use to simulate the behavior of various size of quantum network.

### Workloads
Although AQUA does not focus on the creation of new quantum algorithms, we do work on how to implement known quantum algorithms efficiently on realizable architectures. We also perform the reverse analysis: to implement a given algorithm, how large and how accurate a quantum system is required?

- [IKE for IPsec with QKD](https://aqua.sfc.wide.ad.jp/research/ipsecwithqkd.html)

### Networks
Large systems must combine multiple devices into one system that can compute collaboratively, as well as share information; we are investigating both system-area and wide-area quantum networks.

- quantum recursive network architecture (QRNA), path selection, multiplexing, protocol design, low-level repeater optimization
