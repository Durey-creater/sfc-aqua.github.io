# Research

The primary goal of AQUA is to advance the deployment of quantum technologies in the real world, principally by applying known techniques from classical computer architecture, networking and distributed systems to the problems of scalability in quantum systems. This work will both bring new computational capabilities and help ensure that the progress of information technology does not end when the size of transistors can no longer be reduced.

## Teams

The AQUA group consists of three major teams:

- Computation
- Networking
- Education and Community

Much of the work done is available in [our public GitHub repository](https://github.com/sfc-aqua).

## Computation

Our computation work falls in several areas:

- Algorithms
- Architectures
- Tools for software developers

## Networking

Large systems must combine multiple devices into one system that can compute collaboratively, as well as share information; we are investigating both system-area and wide-area quantum networks.

- [QuISP (Quantum Internet Simulation Package)](https://aqua.sfc.wide.ad.jp/quisp_website/) is one of the most advanced quantum network simulators on the planet.
- [QuISP](https://github.com/sfc-aqua/quisp) is open source.
- We are part of the [Quantum Internet Task Force](https://www.qitf.org).
- We are members of the [Nagayama Moonshot project](https://qitf.org/en/moonshot-nagayama/), where the focus is data center-level interconnects.
- We contribute to, and help run, the [Quantum Internet Research Group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/qirg/about/).

## Education and Community

We are working to create educational materials and to bring together a community of researchers, developers, users and the general public.

- We created our first MOOC on quantum, [Understanding Quantum Computers](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/intro-to-quantum-computing), back in 2017.
- [Q Academy](https://qacademy.jp/en/) is the umbrella for an entire undergraduate quantum curriculum being developed in Japan. Our share of the work is done in both English and Japanese.
- [Q-Lead Edu Quantum Communications](https://www.youtube.com/c/QuantumCommEdu) YouTube channel
- Our first book on the topic, [Quantum Communications](https://github.com/sfc-aqua/Overview-of-Quantum-Communications-E), is available under a Creative Commons license.
